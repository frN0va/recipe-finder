# Recipe Finder Roadmap

## Overview
The Recipe Finder app will allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients, dietary preferences, and cuisine types. The app will fetch data from a public recipe API and present it in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning
1. **Define Requirements**
   - Search recipes by keyword or ingredients.
   - Filter recipes based on dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
   - Display detailed recipe information including ingredients, instructions, and cooking time.
   - Provide a link to the original recipe source.
   
2. **Select Tech Stack**
   - **Frontend**: React, CSS/Styled-components
   - **API**: Edamam, Spoonacular, or similar recipe API
   - **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify

3. **Create Wireframes**
   - Design a simple interface with a search bar, filters, and a results display grid.

4. **Setup Repository**
   - Initialize a GitHub repository.
   - Add basic files: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, etc.

---

### Phase 2: Basic Functionality
1. **Setup React Project**
   - Use `create-react-app` or `Vite` to initialize the project.
   - Organize folder structure: `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/utils`.

2. **Integrate Recipe API**
   - Obtain API key and test API endpoints.
   - Create a utility function for API calls.

3. **Build Core Features**
   - **Search Bar**: Input field for keywords or ingredients.
   - **Recipe Cards**: Display recipe title, image, and basic details.
   - **Pagination**: Load more results or infinite scrolling.

4. **Basic Styling**
   - Apply a simple CSS framework (e.g., TailwindCSS or Material-UI) or custom styles.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Filters**
   - Add dropdowns for dietary preferences, cuisine types, and meal types (e.g., breakfast, dinner).
   - Update API calls dynamically based on filters.

2. **Detailed Recipe View**
   - Create a modal or a dedicated page to show full recipe details.

3. **Favorites Feature**
   - Allow users to save their favorite recipes locally (e.g., using `localStorage`).

4. **Error Handling**
   - Display user-friendly error messages for failed API requests.

---

### Phase 4: Enhancements
1. **User Authentication** (Optional)
   - Enable user accounts with login/signup.
   - Sync favorites across devices using Firebase or a backend service.

2. **Recipe Sharing**
   - Add a feature to share recipes via social media or email.

3. **Offline Mode**
   - Cache favorite recipes for offline access.

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) and end-to-end tests (Cypress).

---

### Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the app to Vercel or Netlify.
   - Ensure proper API key management (e.g., using environment variables).

2. **Monitoring and Updates**
   - Monitor app performance using tools like Google Lighthouse.
   - Collect user feedback and implement improvements.
